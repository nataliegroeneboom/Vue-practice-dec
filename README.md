# Vue-practice-dec - Section 9: Transition Effects in VUE
Vue has transtion effects.  Transition tag is used with a name attribute.  In CSS there are a few classes they start with the 'transition name' prefix and then there is an options of 6 different css transition suffixes to the css classes.  These classes can be divided into enter and leave. The enter controls the starting point, the enter-to provides the leaving point of the entering transition.  The leave-to provides the leaving point of the leaving transition. Neither enter or enter-to are permanent states.  The enter-active class controls the transition process between the starting and ending point.  The enter-active and leave-active classes are permanent, thus should hold the transition attribute.
